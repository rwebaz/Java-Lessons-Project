/** There are four types of primitive 'integers' (whole numbers) in Java
 * Each type of primitive (integer) number corresponds to the number of 'bytes' required...
 * to house each respective variable. Each 'byte' represents 8-bits.
 * The more 'bytes' set aside in memory, the bigger the primitive number (integer) that...
 * the variable placeholder can hold.
 * For example, the primitive (integer) number type 'byte' holds (1) byte or 8-bits of information
 * The primitive number (integer) type 'short' holds (2) bytes or 16-bits of information
 * The primitive number (integer) type 'int' holds (4) bytes or 32-bits of information
 * And, the primitive number (integer) type 'long' holds (8) bytes or 64-bits of information
 *
 * There are also two types of primitive 'real' (decimal numbers) in Java
 * Each type of primitive (real) number corresponds to the number of 'bytes' required...
 * to house each respective variable.
 * The more 'bytes' set aside in memory, the bigger the primitive (real) number and...
 * the greater the accuracy (decimal places) that the variable placeholder can hold.
 * For example, the primitive (real) number type 'float' holds (4) bytes or 32-bits of information
 * And, the primitive (real) number 'double' holds (8) bytes or 64-bits of information.
