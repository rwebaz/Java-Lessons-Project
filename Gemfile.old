# The Gemfile is where you manage Jekyll versioning.
# sass "3.4.23"
# 
# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version of Jekyll, make the changes below.
# And, then save the file and run `bundle install`.
# Bundler will then install the Jekyll version you have described
# Next, run the command 'jekyll' from the Terminal command line ...
# With `bundle exec`, like so:
#
# bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is up and running!
# Happy Jekyll-ing!
#
# Note. If you want to use GitHub Pages, comment out the following gem 'jekyll'
# gem 'jekyll', '3.4.3'
#
# If you want the option to run Jekyll docs locally
gem 'jekyll-docs', '3.4.3'
#
# Note. The default theme for new Jekyll sites is 'minima'.
# gem "minima", "~> 2.0"
# You may change this to anything you like.
gem "jekyll-theme-cayman"
#
# Note. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages` from the command line.
