## Flammarion SVG

The **Flammarion** is an ancient portrait of a medieval man poking his head into the ether beyond the then given celestial sphere upon which all planets traversed guided and pulled by Apollo's all powerful Sun Chariot.

The engraving could have been mastered by the 19th century expounder of science, French astronomer Camille Flammarion.

But, more than likely was created by an unknown designer from the 16th century.

Christopher Columbus knew of the value of understanding "the sphere" and put his knowledge of celestial phenomenon to work when unfortunately on his last voyage to the New World he found himself and his crew marooned after battling a late season hurricane.

The ancient Meso-Americans considered an eclipse to be a "bad omen" such that Columbus while shipwrecked used his knowledge of the occurrences of solar eclipses to extract concessions from the natives.

**Note**. The last full eclipse of the sun across America pror to the year #2017 occurred in the year #1979 ...

Right before the ascent of Ronald Reagan's conservative #GOP movement and administration.

"If you don't give me and my crew some food, I will cause the sun to stop shining!"~ Christopher Columbus, circa 1500 CE

As if by a miracle, the eclipse came at the exact time Columbus ( and, his star charts ) said it would!

Quite a display of astronomical prowess, heh?

The natives were quite impressed by this feat, and scared, too!

As a result, Columbus and his crew were able to stave off starvation, rebuild their ships, and continue on to the Isthmus of Panama.
